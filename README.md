# MONA'S Classic Arcade Game - Udacity Project 3 


*Purpose of this game*
This Game was created by Udacity for us to learn how to do OOP (Object Orientated Program)

*We were provided with the following files*
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. app.js - controls the game logic , this is the file that we had to modify to make the game function 
4. engine.js - This file had the logic and controls of the game we did not have to modify it
5. resources.js - This is where we found our images and resource that were need to succesfully implement our game  

### How to run the application/game

You can launch the program by going to 
[Mona's Arcade Game](https://thenewmona.github.io/monas-arcade-game/)

Or you can Clone/download a copy of of my repo and open the index.html on your browser to load the game.

### Functionalities to be implemented / Use case
You move the player around the board using the arrow keys.
You goal is to reach the water without getting hit by the one of the bugs. 

### Bugs Speed
Bugs are constantly zooming across the canvas at varying speed.
It is your job to avoid colliding with them. 

### Collision
Colliding with any of the zooming bugs will reset the game, and play a sound.

## Udacity Instruction to the student 

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
